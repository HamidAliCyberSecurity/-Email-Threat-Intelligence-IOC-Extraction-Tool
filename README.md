# Email Threat Intelligence & IOC Extraction Tool

## Overview
This project automates the extraction and analysis of email-based Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) using Python. It is designed to support SOC operations, phishing investigations, and threat intelligence workflows by quickly identifying malicious artifacts from email headers and content.

## Key Features
- Extracts Indicators of Compromise (IPs, domains, URLs, email addresses) from emails.
- Analyzes email headers for phishing and threat investigations.
- Automates IOC handling to improve SOC efficiency.
- Generates structured output for reporting and incident response.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Email Header Analysis
- IOC Extraction & Threat Intelligence Concepts
- Security Reporting & Automation
